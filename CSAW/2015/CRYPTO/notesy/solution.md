This one gave a lot of people a bunch of trouble.
When we inputted characters into the box it outputted "ciphertext". 
Turns out, we just needed the key for the encryption in a substition cipher. So, typing in the alphabet resulted in:

"UNHMAQWZIDYPRCJKBGVSLOETXF"

That string is the "key" for a substition cipher.
