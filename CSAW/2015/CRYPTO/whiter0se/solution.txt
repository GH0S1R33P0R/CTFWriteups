looks like a cryptogram of sorts. I just used http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver.php to solve this.
the solution was:
"BUT NO IT WAS A SHORT CUT TO SOMETHING BIGGER SOMETHING GRANDER SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT'S ABOVE US"

If you watched Mr Robot you would recognise that quote from the show.

If you wanted to do this manually, use the following to figure out the letter frequencies

I did solve it by pen and paper to test if it was possible and I found that the substition alphabet was:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
I-F-BO-ELVH-ARUDK--CSWMNTG
